# Pacman-graph-search

a graph search project for AI course in `Noshirvani University of Technology` fall 1402(september2023 - January 2024).

note that i only developed the search algorithms, not the game mechanics and graphics.

## Descriptions
- A* (A Start) search algorithm:
  
  Developed for optimized and faster search and pathfinding using heuristics.
  
- depth-first search(dfs) search algorithm:
  
  Used for deeper search and finding unknown territories and nodes in search space.
  
- breadth-first search(bfs) search algorithm:

  Developed for finding the path with least amount of turns and moves.
  
Also formulated and developed functions for Corners Problem in searchAgents.py, a different problem than solved problems.
